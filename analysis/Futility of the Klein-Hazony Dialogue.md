## Liberalism cannot defeat Fascism in a polite debate.

{{< youtube "Qa_PCNgW79E" "The Man Driving the Nationalist Revival on the Right" >}}

The exchange between **Ezra Klein** and **Yoram Hazony** is not really a debate about the “soul of the nation.” It is a display of a system in deep crisis. To treat it as a clash of ideas, weighing who makes the cleaner argument, misses the point. What they present are rival management strategies for the decline of capitalism, dressed up as philosophy. Klein represents a collapsing liberal order that insists debate and reason can guide us back to stability. Hazony represents an emerging fascism that promises order through hierarchy, exclusion, and coercion. Neither offers liberation. Both aim to preserve the system of exploitation, Klein with the fading language of “shared principles” and Hazony with the blunt discipline of authoritarian nationalism.  

Klein’s role is almost tragic. He thinks Hazony can be cornered with logic, coherence, and appeals to principle. But Hazony is playing a different game. Fascists thrive on contradiction. They speak one way to sound respectable to moderates, then twist their words to give cover to extremists. This slippery ambiguity is not a weakness, it is a strength. It allows Hazony to evade labels in order to maintain power. Klein mistakes this for inconsistency, but it is intentional fascist strategy: bend truth itself into a tool of propaganda. Reason may catch a liberal; it never traps a fascist.  

Liberalism, as Klein embodies it, was never timeless. It was the ideology of global expansion, holding workers together with the promise that anyone could succeed if they bought into a secular creed: equal rights, opportunity, progress. But decades of deindustrialization, collapsing wages, and mounting precarity have destroyed that promise. People sense it, and the rituals of debate and appeals to principle no longer soothe the wounds. Liberals like Klein still argue as if consensus is possible, even while material life reveals irreconcilable conflicts. This blindness unintentionally legitimizes Hazony, conceding to him a seat at the table when he should be called what he is: a fascist.  

Hazony’s so-called National Conservatism is just fascism updated for our moment of economic decline and social fragmentation. Fascism steps in when capitalism can no longer manage its contradictions through liberal democracy. It reroutes class rage away from the real source—the bosses and capital owners—and redirects it toward scapegoats: immigrants, minorities, “outsiders.” Hazony’s myth-making about family, tribe, blood, and soil is propaganda designed to stifle solidarity and turn workers against one another. It tells the laid-off worker that his enemy is not the billionaire who shipped his job overseas but the immigrant who moved next door. This is not innovation. It is the old fascist trick of substituting tribe for class.  

Hazony’s ideas of inherited belonging—blood ties, ancestral graves, “cultural cores”—lay the groundwork for exclusion. Belonging is no longer about choice or principle but birthright. That is how fascism draws its lines: between those who “naturally belong” and those cast as intruders. His call to restore an Anglo-Protestant cultural center is not “patriotism,” it is racialized exclusion, a direct descendant of the slavocracy’s ideology. In practice, this means scapegoating, purges, mass deportations, repression, border militarization, and the production of a vulnerable, hyper-exploited underclass. These measures are not cultural whims. They are economic tools to discipline labor and keep wages down while dividing workers against each other. This is class war from above, papered over with nationalist lies.  

Hazony’s movement does not hide its relationship to more openly racist currents. It pretends to disavow them while leaving the door half open. This is not carelessness, but clever strategy. Fascists know they need both faces: the polite “public intellectual” mask and the violent street enforcer. One normalizes exclusion in the mainstream, the other enforces it through terror. Together they form the machinery of fascist politics.  

Hazony insists this is only a “temporary correction” until the political center stabilizes. This is the oldest lie of authoritarianism. Temporary exceptions always become permanent rules. The goal is not to safeguard democracy, but to destroy working-class organization, scapegoat immigrants, and reinforce capitalist rule. That is the “center” he wants to preserve: a society in which capital is secure, dissent crushed, and cohesion imposed by force.  

The false choice between Klein and Hazony must be rejected outright. Liberalism offers only managed decline, while fascism offers bloody discipline, but both leave capitalist exploitation untouched. To take sides in that theater—to “save liberal democracy” from the fascists—is to defend a system already past its shelf life. The real struggle is not over the meaning of the flag or the fate of “the nation.” It is over who controls the material means of existence: housing, food, energy, work, and care. That struggle does not happen in debate halls, but in workplaces, neighborhoods, and communities where everyday life is fought over and built.  

The path forward is not Klein’s hollow liberalism or Hazony’s fascist authoritarianism. It is the construction of real power at the base: tenant unions against landlords, worker cooperatives against bosses, mutual aid networks against the indifference of state and market. It is shared kitchens, off-grid power, collective childcare, and communal healthcare built in defiance of systems that profit from our dependence. Hazony weaponizes nationalism to break worker solidarity. Our task is to build solidarity rooted in immediate material needs, not myths.  

This is slow, unglamorous work, but it is the only way to render their theater irrelevant. It turns the fight from their realm of ghosts and propaganda back to reality: clean water, secure shelter, food without fear, energy under our control, bonds of trust between people who refuse to be divided. Fascism thrives on despair and division. Real liberation grows from autonomy, solidarity, and survival.  

The choice in front of us is stark. Either we are divided by the myths of nation and sacrificed to capital, or we reclaim control over daily existence and dismantle the foundations that keep fascists like Hazony in power. No debate will decide this. Only organized, material action will.
