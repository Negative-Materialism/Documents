Jacobin, a magazine often hailed as a voice of the American left, has once again demonstrated its tendency to indulge in liberal moralizing under the guise of leftist analysis. In their recent article "[Charlie Kirk’s Murder Is a Tragedy and a Disaster](https://jacobin.com/2025/09/charlie-kirk-murder-political-violence)," co-authored by Ben Burgis and Meagan Day, the publication presents a view of Charlie Kirk's assassination that is not only misguided but also strategically naive. Here I aim to deconstruct Jacobin's argument and expose the liberal underpinnings that undermine their supposedly leftist perspective.

First and foremost, it is crucial to challenge the very premise of the article that Charlie Kirk's assassination is a tragedy. Kirk, a prominent figure in the right-wing propaganda machine, was a steadfast advocate for policies that disproportionately harmed women, the working class, people of color, and the LGBTQA community. His rhetoric was notorious for its xenophobic, misogynistic, and anti-intellectual stances. To label his death a tragedy is to engage in a form of liberal sentimentality that obscures the realities of class struggle and the systemic 
Jacobin's article begins by stating, *"The violence perpetuated The by figures like Kirk.
assassination of Kirk is a tragedy. Morally, it is unjustifiable. Politically, it is cause for serious alarm."* This sentiment reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of political violence and its potential role in class struggle. Political violence, when strategically employed, can be a powerful tool for challenging the status quo and advancing the interests of the proletariat. Kirk's death, rather than a tragedy, is a manifestation of the violence inherent in the capitalist system he so vigorously defended.

From the start the editorial Jacobin cedes ground to the fascists by implying that the assassin could be from within the left milieu, even before any evidence was available. This is a strategic mistake that gives the right a rope to hang us with. The assassin, later identified to likely have been a right-wing white nationalist, killed Kirk out of reactionary authoritarian intent. By jumping to the conclusion that the left might be responsible, Jacobin has unwittingly played into the hands of those who seek to portray the left as violent and intolerant.

The article goes on to state, "A larger spiral into political violence would be a catastrophe for the Left." This assertion is not only mistaken but also reveals a lack of understanding of the historical role of violence in revolutionary movements. The Left has often harnessed the power of collective action and strategic violence to advance its causes. Kirk's assassination, had it been part of such a strategy, could have served as a symbol of resistance against right-wing extremism.

Jacobin's broad rejection of political violence is a pitiful display of ideological weakness. They suggest that political violence threatens the very fabric of liberation, but this is a dangerous and misleading notion. The ruling class has long understood that violence is a powerful tool, wielding it daily through state repression, economic coercion, and imperialist warfare. The left, on the other hand, is often portrayed as the aggressor, even when it is merely defending itself.

The assassination of Charlie Kirk was not an uncontrolled act of violence as Jacobin suggests. It was a targeted strike against a key figure in the right-wing propaganda machine. Unfortunately, it was carried out by someone from within the right's own ranks, a disgruntled nationalist who saw Kirk as a traitor to the true fascist cause. This tells us something about the internal contradictions and brutality of the right, not the left.

Jacobin’s article fails to grasp the true nature of political violence and the necessity of a materialist perspective. Instead of focusing on whether political violence is justifiable in the abstract, we should be evaluating which acts of violence serve the interests of the proletariat. The assassination of Kirk, an ardent supporter of the exploiters of the working class, could have been a powerful symbolic act had it been part of a leftist strategy. It could have inspired a wave of resistance against the right-wing agenda, a rallying cry for the oppressed.

The left must not be lulled into complacency by liberal ideals that have been consistently used to protect the oppressive regime of the ruling class. Jacobin’s analysis is fundamentally flawed because it embraces liberal moralizing, asserting that no one deserves death for political expression. This perspective aligns Jacobin with bourgeois humanism, which obscures the reality that politics is an extension of war by other means.

By framing Kirk’s murder as a threat to "democratic norms" and "free speech," Jacobin fails to recognize that such norms exist only as ideological cover for ruling-class hegemony. The left must develop a rigorous, materialist perspective that understands the role of violence in class struggle and uses it strategically to advance proletarian interests. We need to move beyond empty condemnations and embrace a dialectical understanding that sees violence as a legitimate tool when in the hands of a mobilized working class pursuing revolutionary socialism.

The real challenge for the left is to develop a strategic approach to political violence that serves the interests of the proletariat. Individual acts of violence, divorced from mass action, cannot substitute for the patient work of building proletarian organizations capable of wielding force collectively. They often substitute cathartic but ultimately counterproductive expressions of rage for disciplined revolutionary practice.

This perspective requires abandoning the moralistic frameworks of liberal ideology and embracing a more dialectical understanding of class conflict. Only then can the left begin to truly advance the cause of socialism. Let us not be fooled by liberal platitudes; revolutionary clarity demands a materialist analysis of class struggle and the instruments of violence that serve it.

Charlie Kirk's death is a reminder that even the most vocal proponents of reactionary ideologies can fall victim to the very forces they unleash. It is a testament to the power of ideology and the potential for violence inherent in a system that values profit over people. The left must learn from this, not mourn it. We must harness both the symbolic and material potential of such acts, recognizing that sometimes, violence can serve revolutionary ends.

Jacobin’s article is a disappointing reflection of when liberal values pop up in leftist spaces and attempt to capture or co-opt the essence of revolutionary struggle. By moralizing over political violence, they miss the strategic opportunity to analyze the potential gains and losses of specific actions. The true tragedy is not in Kirk's death but in the left's failure to effectively utilize such events to advance its cause.

In their article, Jacobin laments, "Without them, collective self-governance is impossible and tyranny becomes inevitable." This statement reveals a naive faith in the institutions of bourgeois democracy, which have consistently failed to deliver true self-governance for the working class. The left must understand that the path to genuine self-governance lies not in the defense of liberal democratic norms but in the revolutionary overthrow of the capitalist system.

Moreover, Jacobin's article suggests that the left should "trust our fellow citizens to be exposed to every point of view, even the worst ones, and to make up their own minds." This liberal ideal of "free speech" ignores the reality that capitalism structures public discourse in ways that perpetuate the dominance of ruling-class ideologies. The left must not be content with mere exposure to different viewpoints; it must actively challenge and dismantle the systems that produce and reproduce oppression.

The article also warns of a "descent into tit-for-tat political violence," presenting this as a threat to the left's political culture. However, a historical materialist perspective reveals that periods of intense class struggle often involve high levels of political violence. The left must be prepared to engage in such struggles, not retreat from them. The fear of violence should not deter us from pursuing our revolutionary goals.

Jacobin's analysis is further undermined by its failure to acknowledge the systemic violence inherent in capitalism. The magazine's liberal moralizing obscures the fact that capitalism itself is a violent system, one that exploits and oppresses the working class on a global scale. Political violence, when directed against the architects of this system, can be a legitimate form of resistance.

Furthermore, Jacobin's article suggests that the left should focus on "winning over the vast majority of the population to our side." While this is a laudable goal, it ignores the reality that the ruling class will not relinquish power without a fight. The left must be prepared to use all means necessary, including violence, to achieve its objectives. The path to socialism is not paved with liberal pieties but with the blood of those who dare to challenge the status quo.

The magazine also expresses concern about the potential for a "crackdown on left-wing activists" in the wake of Kirk's assassination. While this is a valid concern, it should not deter the left from taking bold action. The history of social movements shows that periods of repression often precede significant advances. The left must be ready to navigate such challenges, using them as opportunities to build greater solidarity and strength.

Jacobin's article concludes by stating, "The Left will not win that battle." This defeatist attitude is typical of liberal ideologies that prioritize incremental reform over revolutionary change. The left must reject such pessimism and embrace a vision of transformative violence that can upend the existing order and create the conditions for a truly emancipated society.

In summary, Jacobin's response to Charlie Kirk's assassination is a disappointment, reflecting the magazine's tendency to indulge in liberal moralizing at the expense of revolutionary clarity. By framing Kirk's death as a tragedy and rejecting political violence out of hand, Jacobin misses an opportunity to analyze the strategic potential of such events. The left must develop a more nuanced and strategic understanding of political violence, one that recognizes its role in advancing the cause of socialism.

The assassination of Charlie Kirk, while not a tragedy, is a reminder of the ongoing class struggle and the need for a left that is unafraid to use every tool at its disposal to advance the cause of socialism. Let us ensure that Kirk's demise serves as a catalyst for greater action, not just a moment of liberal reflection. The struggle continues, and the left must be prepared to fight on all fronts, with both words and, when necessary, deeds.

Rest in piss, Charlie Kirk. Your death, while not a tragedy, is a reminder of the ongoing class struggle and the need for a left that is unafraid to use every tool at its disposal to advance the cause of socialism. Let us ensure that your demise serves as a catalyst for greater action, not just a moment of liberal reflection. The struggle continues, and the left must be prepared to fight on all fronts, with both words and, when necessary, deeds. Your reactionary ideology has met its match, not in the form of a tragic end, but in the ongoing struggle for a just and equal society.
