## Ezra Klein is siding with Fascism to advance his career.

The recent conversation between Ezra Klein and Ben Shapiro reveals precisely the fatal flaw identified in my previous analysis, [Futility of The Klein-Hazony Dialogue](https://negativematerialism.press/analysis/futility-of-the-klein-hazony-dialogue/), the liberal delusion that fascism can be debated into civility. Klein's opening admission about Charlie Kirk's murder, while expressing grief over the killing, simultaneously whitewashes Kirk's role as a leading fascist ideologue. This rhetorical strategy of equating the senseless violence of Kirk's assassination with legitimate criticism of his fascist ideology represents a profound failure to recognize the nature of the enemy we face.

Kirk, like Shapiro and Trump, promoted fascist politics openly. Trump remains the leader of this fascist movement, having returned to power with nearly half the popular vote. Klein's desperate plea that "we are going to have to live with one another" fails to confront the fundamental truth that fascism is not just a difference of opinion but an existential threat that must be eradicated, not accommodated. His call to "look for what we can recognize in one another" with fascists is not bridge-building but surrender to forces that seek the destruction of everything decent.

The conversation itself becomes part of the reproduction of fascist power by treating it as just another political position rather than an existential threat to human liberation. Nowhere is this clearer than in Klein's attempt to befriend his would-be executioners. By platforming Shapiro and treating fascist ideology as merely another perspective in the "marketplace of ideas," Klein participates in what the Frankfurt School called *repressive tolerance*. This false equivalence is not neutral but actively serves the interests of capital by normalizing beliefs that would destroy democracy.

A materialist analysis makes clear that fascism arises during times of capitalist crisis, when the ruling class requires extra-parliamentary violence to maintain its grip on power. What Klein naively calls "MAGA Republicanism" is pure fascism, the systematic dismantling of democratic norms, the scapegoating of immigrants and minorities, and the creation of a cult of personality around Trump. Klein's approach of understanding and accommodating this movement through dialogue only strengthens it.

The aftermath of Kirk's murder demonstrates fascism's trajectory. While some rightly recognized Kirk as the dangerous ideologue he was, and as I covered in  [Rest in Piss Charlie Kirk](https://negativematerialism.press/analysis/rest-in-piss-charlie-kirk/), the fascist are mourning him as a martyr, and using his death to justify further violence against the liberalism Klein is digging the ditch for. This follows the fascist playbook perfectly, any resistance to fascism, whether violent or electoral, is used as evidence of left-wing terror requiring an authoritarian barbarism.

Klein's claim that Kirk represented a legitimate political voice simply because he showed up on college campuses reveals the bankruptcy of liberal pluralism. Would Klein extend this courtesy to overt neo-Nazis? Their ideas would certainly qualify as "standard-fare" among their followers, but that doesn't make them worthy of platforming or protection from criticism. The logic is identical for fascist ideologues like Kirk or Shapiro, their mainstream acceptance doesn't validate their ideas; it indicts the political landscape that has normalized them.

Ben Shapiro, presented here as a reasonable conservative voice, is himself a fascist propagandist. His "Lions and Scavengers" framework is pure social Darwinism, painting progressive movements as parasitic threats to civilization. Klein's respectful engagement with this ideological garbage provides it respectable cover while obscuring its fascist essence. Shapiro's argument that the left is motivated purely by envy and destruction serves to dehumanize opponents and justify right-wing violence against them.

Klein's handwringing about political violence becomes particularly grotesque when he equates left-wing critique of Kirk with Kirk's own violent rhetoric. This false equivalence is the hallmark of liberal false consciousness, unable to distinguish between the violence of the oppressor and the resistance of the oppressed, liberals like Klein ultimately side with order over justice. His concern about online algorithms amplifying extremism ignores that these platforms systematically privilege reactionary content while suppressing leftist voices.

The conversation's persistent avoidance of class analysis is telling. Neither Klein nor Shapiro can or will address how capitalism creates the conditions for fascism to emerge. Instead, we get pious appeals to "civilization" and "responsible politics" that ignore the material basis of our current crisis. When working people face exploitation and immiseration, they don't need hand-wringing about the tone of discourse, they need revolutionary organization.

The crisis of late capitalism has left workers increasingly desperate and alienated. Fascist movements like MAGA offer scapegoats to explain their suffering—immigrants, minorities, cultural elites—while leaving the actual source of exploitation untouched. Klein's refusal to name this dynamic, his insistence on finding common ground with those who would destroy him, represents not philosophical depth but cowardice in the face of existential threat.

The alternative to this false choice is not liberal nostalgia but organized class struggle. The material conditions that produced fascism—falling wages, widening inequality, environmental collapse—cannot be debated away. Only through the construction of counter-power rooted in workplaces and communities can working people defend their interests against both liberal betrayal and fascist reaction.

The Klein-Shapiro dialogue represents the total bankruptcy of liberal approaches to the rise of fascism. Where previous generations might have recognized fascist movements as existential threats that must be defeated, not debated, neoliberalism has reduced politics to a series of academic seminars disconnected from material conditions or class struggle. The urgent need is to build working-class organizations capable of physically resisting fascism, not providing it with intellectual respectability through "reasoned debate."

Klein's project of fostering understanding through dialogue doesn't merely fail to solve the problem, it actively makes it worse by normalizing fascist ideas and treating them as legitimate topics for debate. His pleas for mutual recognition with apologists for authoritarianism demonstrate the terminal crisis of liberalism. Instead of listening to these reactionary voices with patience, we should be organizing against them with all necessary force, because the choice isn't between dialogue and violence, it's between their violence and ours, between fascism and freedom.

History offers no middle ground. Fascism must be crushed before it completes its consolidation of power. The democratic pretenses masking Trump's second term should fool no one, his administration's systematic assault on democratic norms, combined with open appeals to white nationalist sentiment, represents fascism in its contemporary American form. Klein's continuing failure to name this reality makes him complicit in the normalization of fascist politics.

The task is not to understand fascism better but to destroy it utterly. Only revolutionary working-class organization, rooted in the material interests of the majority, can achieve this. The "civility" and "dialogue" that Klein champions serve only to preserve the rotting corpse of liberal capitalism, allowing fascism to gestate within its decay. We must abandon his bankrupt project entirely and prepare for the inevitable confrontation that approaches. In the immortal words of Buenaventura Durruti, "The only church that illuminates is a burning church."
