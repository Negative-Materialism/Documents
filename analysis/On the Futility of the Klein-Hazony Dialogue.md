<!-- # On the Futility of the Klein-Hazony Dialogue -->
## Two Failed Protocols for Capitalist Management

The public exchange between Ezra Klein and Yoram Hazony, staged as a civil inquiry into the future of the American political order, must be understood as a conversation over a system in decay. It is a superstructural performance in which two competing factions of the ruling class articulate their preferred strategies for managing the intractable contradictions of late capitalism. To engage this dialogue on its own terms—to morally condemn Klein for the act of "platforming" or to dismiss Hazony with the simple epithet of "fascist"—is to remain ensnared within the very ideological framework that requires dismantling. A materialist analysis, grounded in the principles of a negative dialectic, must refuse this trap. It must treat both interlocutors not as sovereign moral agents, but as functionaries of distinct, yet ultimately complementary, systems of social control. The interview is a clinical exhibition of a failed Reified Symbolic Mandate (RSM), that of liberal creedalism, attempting to apply its obsolete logical protocols to a new and aggressive political technology, National Conservatism, whose very existence is a material counterexample—a "Russell’s Monster"—to the liberal order’s claim of universal validity.

The role of Ezra Klein in this performance is that of the conscientious manager of a collapsing paradigm. His entire methodological approach, a patient and persistent search for logical coherence and internal consistency within Hazony’s worldview, perfectly embodies the liberal tactical protocol ($\mathcal{L}_{Liberal}$). This protocol operates on the foundational assumption that political struggle is a contest of ideas, waged within a shared, rational space, and that victory is achieved by exposing the opponent’s logical fallacies or hypocrisies. Klein’s repeated expressions of confusion—"I don’t understand," "there’s some contradiction there"—are not feigned; they are the genuine expressions of a worldview confronting a phenomenon that operates outside its established rules. He is attempting to debug a software program, blind to the fact that the underlying hardware is melting down. This liberal protocol was historically effective precisely because its corresponding ideology, the `RSM_Liberal` of creedal nationalism, served the material needs of a specific phase of capital accumulation. The notion that a nation is a voluntary association bound by abstract principles of liberty and equality was the ideal superstructural lubricant for the era of neoliberal globalization. It rationalized the creation of a vast, mobile, and interchangeable global labor pool, justifying the erosion of national sovereignty in favor of transnational capital flows and institutions. Belonging was defined by belief, not birth, a necessary fiction for an economic system that required maximum human fungibility.

However, the material Base that sustained this liberal superstructure has disintegrated. Decades of deindustrialization in the imperial core, the financialization of the economy, and the automation of labor have produced endemic precarity, atomization, and a vast surplus population. The promise of inclusion and upward mobility that gave the liberal creed its material force has been revealed as a fraud. Consequently, the liberal protocol has lost its efficacy. Logical critique is impotent against a political force animated by the raw, material experience of dispossession. Klein’s failure is not personal; it is systemic. He is searching for a single, stable probability distribution over the political landscape—a final, coherent synthesis—while the reality of our moment is a non-convergent state of plural, mutually exclusive antagonisms. The political landscape is now formally represented by a credal set, a state of irreducible uncertainty and conflict. Klein’s attempt to find a common ground with Hazony is an exercise in futility, a category error in the face of an anti-synthesis where contradictions are not resolved, but are instead held in a permanent state of low-grade civil war. By continuing to offer the platform of rational debate, he performs a vital, if unintentional, service for the rising authoritarianism: he legitimizes it as a reasonable pole in a spectrum of ideas, obscuring its true function as a raw instrument of class power.

Yoram Hazony’s project, National Conservatism, provides the formal ideological architecture for what is structurally and functionally fascism. This is not hyperbole but a precise technical description of its material purpose. Fascism is not an aesthetic of jackboots and rallies; it is a specific political technology that emerges when the contradictions of capitalism become unmanageable through the ordinary mechanisms of liberal-democratic consent. Its primary function is to resolve the crisis of class antagonism by sublimating it into a national, cultural, or racial struggle, thereby preserving the material Base—the relations of private property and wage labor—by radically reconfiguring the Superstructure. Hazony’s framework is the `RSM_NatCon` that provides the necessary justification, the sanctifying "spook," for this violent reconfiguration.

The theoretical triptych of "families, tribes, and nations" is the cornerstone of this mystification. It is a deliberate and sophisticated attempt to replace the concrete, material, and inherently conflictual category of *class* with the ethereal, organicist fiction of a tribal bond rooted in blood and soil. The "mutual loyalty" he posits is not a sociological description but a prescriptive command aimed directly at the working class: the laid-off factory worker must recognize a sacred bond of loyalty with the finance capitalist who offshored his job, on the grounds that they share a common language, a common religion, or a common ancestor buried in a Kentucky graveyard. This is the very essence of false consciousness—the substitution of an imaginary, vertical bond of nation for the real, horizontal antagonism of class.

This ideological maneuver is operationalized in the political mythology of figures like JD Vance. The recurring story of the cemetery plot is a tactical weapon designed to redefine belonging. It frames Americanness not as a commitment to a set of universal and falsifiable principles, but as an immutable, inherited status. This redefinition is the essential precondition for the fascist project, as it provides the ideological basis for dividing the population into two groups: those who belong by right of lineage, and those who are, by definition, alien interlopers and illegitimate claimants on the social product. Hazony’s call to rebuild a "dominant center" based on an Anglo-Protestant cultural core is the explicit program for this purgative politics. It is a declaration that the polity can no longer be held together by the thin gruel of shared interests or democratic norms, but requires the hegemonic power of a single, dominant tribe to enforce "cohesion." This historical narrative, which posits a past of organic unity now shattered by the poisons of multiculturalism and immigration, is a deliberate inversion of reality. The American project has been defined by violent internal conflict from its inception, culminating in a civil war fought precisely to defend a particularist, blood-and-soil vision of hierarchy against a nascent universalist creed. Hazony and Vance are not proposing a new path forward; they are attempting to resurrect the ideology of the slavocracy, retooled for an age of post-industrial serfdom.

The movement’s obsession with immigration and diversity serves as the primary mechanism for scapegoating. It is a strategy to redirect the legitimate rage of a materially insecure population away from the architects of their precarity—the capitalist class—and toward a designated internal enemy. The mantra of a "15 percent maximum" for the foreign-born population is a political fabrication, a demographically illiterate alarm bell designed to manufacture a sense of existential crisis. This manufactured crisis then serves to justify the authoritarian measures required to "restore order": mass deportations, the militarization of the border, and the stripping of civil liberties from non-citizens. These policies are not merely cultural expressions; they are instruments of labor discipline. By creating a super-exploited and politically vulnerable underclass of immigrant labor, capital can exert downward pressure on the wages of the entire working class. By fomenting racial and ethnic division, it prevents the formation of a unified, multiracial class consciousness that would pose a genuine threat to its rule.

Similarly, the strategic porousness of the border between mainstream National Conservatism and the explicitly white supremacist right is not a sign of ideological confusion but of tactical discipline. Hazony’s disavowal of the "kooky Nazi right" is a necessary piece of public relations, but the distinction is functionally decorative. The core logic of ethnocentric hierarchy is useful to class power, regardless of its specific branding. The energy of the racist right is a potent force for atomizing the working class and terrorizing political opponents. It will be courted, tolerated, and strategically deployed as long as it serves this purpose, as evidenced by the recurring alliances and symbolic gestures, like Donald Trump’s dinner with Nick Fuentes, which signal to these currents that they have a place within the broader reactionary coalition.

Ultimately, the National Conservative project is structurally fascistic because its objective class function aligns with the historical definition of fascism as the emergency committee of the bourgeoisie. Its program—a militant Christian-nationalist identity, the fusion of corporate and state power under a protectionist industrial policy, a patriarchal cult of the traditional family, the violent repression of dissent, and a relentless assault on any form of independent working-class organization—is the textbook response of a capitalist class in crisis. It seeks to resolve the contradictions of capital not by transcending them, but by managing them through force.

Hazony’s promise that this period of "aggressive" and "illiberal" action is merely a temporary phase to "strengthen the center," after which tolerance can be restored, is the oldest and most transparent sophism of reaction. It is the authoritarian’s alibi: a temporary state of exception is required to save the constitutional order; a temporary repression is necessary to restore pluralism. This is a deliberate deception. While the nation is being culturally and politically disciplined, the material relations of production are secured. The worker is politically neutered, the immigrant is used as a cudgel, and capital is insulated from democratic challenge. The "center" being rebuilt is nothing more than the bourgeoisie’s preferred superstructural order, fortified with the coercive power of the state.

The core of the matter is this: polarization in a capitalist society is not, at its root, an argument over flags, values, or historical narratives. It is the surface expression of a fundamental and irreconcilable class contradiction—the struggle between those who own the means of production and those who must sell their labor power to survive. This can be expressed in the cold language of political economy: the rate of exploitation, $e = s/v$, is the ratio of surplus value ($s$) created by labor to the variable capital ($v$) paid out in wages. Every plank of the National Conservative platform is a strategy to increase *e*. Fragmenting the working class along lines of race, religion, and nationality prevents the solidarity necessary to demand higher wages (a higher $v$). Using the state to smash unions, deport immigrant organizers, and intimidate left-wing dissidents directly suppresses the struggle over the division of the social product, ensuring a larger share remains as surplus value ($s$). Hazony’s "cohesion" is the cohesion of the chain gang.

Therefore, a meaningful strategic response must begin by utterly rejecting the false choice presented in the dialogue between Klein and Hazony. The struggle is not to defend a failing `RSM_Liberal` against an ascendant `RSM_NatCon`. It is not to win an argument over the true meaning of the American nation—a "spook" of the highest order. The struggle is for control over the material means of existence. The only effective praxis is one that operates in a dual-domain, targeting both the Superstructure and the Base.

In the superstructural mode, the task is one of relentless negation and immanent critique. One must refuse the terms of the debate, systematically exposing the class function of every nationalist policy. The border wall is not about culture; it is a tool of labor discipline. The attack on "woke neo-Marxism" is not a philosophical disagreement; it is a pre-emptive strike against any analytical framework that centers class. Vance’s graveyard is not about heritage; it is a fetish object used to mystify the material reality that his policies will further entrench the power of the ownership class.

But this superstructural fight is secondary. The decisive domain is infrastructural. The appeal of fascism grows in the vacuum of material security and genuine community created by capitalism. The only effective antidote is the painstaking construction of autonomous material power from below. This requires the formation of Unions of Egoists—concrete, flexible alliances based on shared, immediate material interests. This is not an abstract call for unity but a specific program of action: the organization of militant tenant unions to fight landlords and decommodify housing; the creation of worker cooperatives and solidarity economies to establish non-exploitative relations of production; the building of independent logistical networks for food, communication, and care to reduce dependence on the capitalist Base. Each of these actions must be measured by its capacity to expand usufruct (direct control over the means of life), deepen complementarity (bonds of mutual reliance outside the state and the market), and defend the irreducible minimum (guaranteed access to what is needed to live). This is the only praxis that can render the debate between Klein and Hazony irrelevant. It does not seek to win the argument over which ghost should haunt the decaying house of the old republic; it seeks to build a new one altogether, on a foundation of material autonomy, leaving the dead to bury their dead.
