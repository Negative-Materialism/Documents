##  Kirk’s calculation that gun deaths were worth the price of liberty perfectly mimics the irony of capitalism. 

{{< image src="rest_in_piss_charlie_kirk.webp" alt="Charlie Kirk was assassinated on September 10th, 2025" >}}

The bourgeois press weeps for a fallen ideologue, framing the demise of Charlie Kirk as a tragedy of political violence. Let’s be honest, this wasn’t a tragedy. His assassination was the consequence of his own reactionary political ideology steeped in the rhetoric of violence. With this in mind, we must analyze this event not with liberal sentimentality and pearl clutching currently being bandied about, but with a materialist rigor that doesn’t moralize fallen reprobates. Kirk’s end was the logical conclusion of the very forces he unleashed, a violent symptom of a social order in a state of advanced decay. He lived by the gun, ideologically speaking, and he perished by it.

The crocodile tears of liberal politicians likes of Gavin Newsom and Kamala Harris, who preside over a system of relentless police violence, imperialist slaughter, and the slow death of economic deprivation, now feign horror at a single act of “reprehensible” violence. Their selective outrage is a performance meant to uphold bourgeois order. We are told to mourn Kirk, but when were we asked to mourn the thousands of Palestinian children immolated by the weaponry of capital’s imperial proxies? If these liberals could summon even a fraction of their current indignation for the victims of their own system, their pronouncements might carry weight. Instead, they inundate us with their sanctimonious noise, revealing that their concern is not for life but for the stability of their class rule.

Charlie Kirk was not a philosopher, he wasn't even a decent debater, what he was, was a functionary. His purpose was to manufacture consent for the ruling class, to keep the proletariat confused and divided. His organization, Turning Point USA, served as a conduit for Christofascist ideology, packaging the interests of capital as the “God-given rights” of the common man. His frantic defense of the Second Amendment was never about popular defense against tyranny, it was about sanctifying private property and the right of the individual capitalist to protect their assets against the working class. By convincing a segment of that very same working class that their interests align with their exploiters, Kirk performed a valuable service, generating a thick fog of false consciousness to obscure the reality of class antagonism.

> “You will never live in a society when you have an armed citizenry and you won’t have a single gun death… That is nonsense. It’s drivel. But I think it’s worth to have a cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the _Second Amendment_ to protect our other God-given rights. That is a prudent deal. It is rational. Nobody talks like this. They live in a complete alternate universe.

To fully grasp the American obsession with firearms that Kirk so effectively manipulated, one must understand the concept of [commodity fetishism](https://www.workers.org/2013/02/7256/). The gun is not merely a tool, it is a fetishized object, imbued by bourgeois ideology with mystical powers of freedom, sovereignty, and security. This fetishism obscures the real social relations of its production and its function as an instrument of class society. It appears as a sacred relic of liberty, detached from the systemic violence it perpetuates. This is how a rational-sounding argument can be made for accepting thousands of deaths as a “prudent deal.” The real, material horror of a near-daily parade of dead children is rendered abstract, less important than the worship of a fetishized commodity and the ideology it represents.

The dialectic is a merciless process. A force, once unleashed, inevitably calls forth its opposite. Kirk and his ilk championed a society saturated with the instruments of death, arguing that an armed citizenry was the ultimate check on state power. What they cultivated was not a bulwark against government overreach, but a paranoid, atomized society where violence becomes the first resort for settling disputes, both personal and political. They sowed the wind of violent rhetoric and paranoid fantasies, and in Utah, the whirlwind was reaped. His death serves as an example of what the anarchists once called [_propaganda of the deed_](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/category/topic/propaganda-of-the-deed), an act of violence intended to inspire others to action.   
> “We have to be vicious, just like they are. It’s the only thing they understand.”

This quote from his [Twitter account](https://x.com/charliekirk11/status/1965458939644109294) the day before his assassination was a call to action. Kirk was telling those he had made a career out of manipulating that it was time to engage in violent acts against their perceived enemies. And in an ironic twist of fate the first act of violence was turned back on its most vocal proponent. In a way his death was his own kind of praxis, the unity of theory and practice, in its most brutal and direct form. His ideology of unrestrained viciousness became the force that destroyed him.

Now, the forces of fascist reaction, led by figures like Donald Trump, will attempt to transform this dead pundit into a martyr. They will seek to make Charlie Kirk the [Horst Wessel](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/albert-meltzer-anarchist-activity-in-nazi-germany) of a burgeoning American fascist movement, using his death to justify greater repression, more surveillance, and the further arming of right-wing paramilitaries. The assassination of one man, however odious his views, will not advance the cause of liberation. Instead, his assassination will strengthen the hand of the state and provides the perfect pretext for fascism’s advance. Ultimately, this act of violence demonstrates the futility of individual terror. It is a satisfying expression of rage, to be sure, but it is not a strategy for power.

The christofascists that produced Kirk will simply find another to take his place, perhaps more polished, or more rabid, and with a smaller head. Removing a single easily replaceable ideologue, no matter how deserving, does nothing to alter the fundamental fascist trajectory of the American superstructure. Such acts are a politics of despair, a symptom of the absence of a mass, organized working-class movement. They allow the state to reinforce its monopoly on violence and portray all opposition to capitalism as criminal and terroristic, thereby isolating genuine revolutionaries from the masses whose support is essential. The proper response to the violence of capitalism is not the isolated violence of the assassin, but the organized, _collective power of the mobilized working class_.

Our task is not to target individual personifications of economic categories but to abolish the categories of class society itself. Nor should our goal be a form of self-sabotage where we push for the disarmament of the people while Trump builds a fascist cage around us. No, this moment requires the patient work of education, agitation, and organization to build mobilized class consciousness. The worker must learn to see that their enemy is not a single loudmouthed pundit, but the entire system of wage labor and private property. So, let the liberals perform their empty rituals of mourning and let the fascists attempt to construct their martyr. We understand that Kirk’s death was as meaningless as his life and that this incident is merely another crack appearing in the facade of a dying social order.

Rest in piss you sniveling fuck.
## Jacobin's Liberal Indulgence

The [Jacobin](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:swj6nxxfi5gcpgjdzvo25cri) article [Charlie Kirk’s Murder Is a Tragedy and a Disaster](https://jacobin.com/2025/09/charlie-kirk-murder-political-violence) typifies the hollow moralistic condemnations characteristic of liberals, rather than leftists committed to a material analysis of class society. By arguing that political violence jeopardizes democracy, the perspectives shared by [Ben Burgis](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:4kjhktszj7qk26x7efwth62m) and Meagan Day are rooted in a liberal hand-wringing that upholds bourgeois norms. This approach is at odds with our need to adopt a purely materialist perspective, one focused on strategic action informed by class struggle imperatives rather than abstract moral stances.

Instead of debating whether political violence is justifiable in the abstract, we should assess which acts of violence serve proletarian interests and which do not. The assassination of Charlie Kirk appears to be an isolated, adventurist act, disconnected from any organized working-class movement or strategy. Consequently, it remains unclear how this action advances socialist objectives. Jacobin's blanket rejection of political violence supports a liberal narrative that treats state violence and anti-capitalist resistance as morally equivalent, when they fundamentally differ in nature and purpose. State violence is systematic and structural, while anti-capitalist violence is often defensive and tactical.

Jacobin's analysis is also flawed because it embraces liberal moralizing. By claiming that no one should die for political views, Jacobin aligns itself with bourgeois humanism, which obscures the truth that politics is an extension of war by other means. They frame Kirk’s murder as a threat to "democratic norms" and "free speech," failing to acknowledge that these norms serve as ideological cover for ruling-class hegemony. The ruling class commonly employs violence through state repression, economic coercion, and imperialist warfare. Yet, Jacobin suggests that the Left should unilaterally disarm morally and rhetorically in this critical struggle.

We must evaluate not whether political violence is justifiable in theory, but whether specific acts serve proletarian interests. The assassination of Charlie Kirk seems to be an isolated, adventurist act, unconnected to any organized working-class movement or strategy. As such, it is difficult to see how it advances socialist objectives. However, Jacobin's wholesale rejection of political violence plays into the hands of our enemies by reinforcing the liberal fiction that state and anti-capitalist violence are morally equivalent. This oversight is significant because state violence is systematic and structural, while anti-capitalist violence is primarily defensive and strategic.

Moreover, Jacobin's concern regarding potential increased repression following Kirk’s death lacks substance from a materialist perspective. History shows that the ruling class does not need a pretext to attack working-class organizations, as they have done continuously regardless of any provocation. If anything, the liberal plea for calm and "de-escalation" only emboldens fascist forces by signaling that the Left can be intimidated into passivity. We have observed this dynamic repeatedly. The suggestion that if we only condemn violence loudly enough, capitalists will reciprocate, is at best naive and at worst actively detrimental to building strong working-class organizations capable of resisting fascism.

Jacobin also erred in adopting the emotional language of "tragedy" and "disaster" to describe Kirk’s death. This sentimentality reflects bourgeois sensibilities rather than revolutionary clarity. Kirk was an avowed enemy of the working class, actively working to undermine even minimal reforms that could improve proletarian living standards. The irony that his violent rhetoric and policies may have contributed to a climate conducive to political violence is worth noting, as it reveals the contradictions of the system he served. It is unnecessary to mourn oppressors, even when they fall victim to tactics unrelated to our own strategic orientation.

Rather than moralizing, revolutionaries must analyze. The true issue with Kirk’s assassination is not its violence per se, but that it appears to be an isolated act divorced from any broader working-class movement or strategy. Individual acts of violence, separate from mass action, cannot replace the patient work of building proletarian organizations capable of collective force. These isolated acts often serve as cathartic but ultimately counterproductive expressions of rage, rather than contributing to disciplined revolutionary practice. This is the substantive critique worth making, not abstract liberal pieties about the sanctity of life or democratic norms.

The Left must be willing to utilize both the symbolic and material potential of such acts, recognizing that sometimes, violence can serve revolutionary ends. This perspective necessitates abandoning the moralistic frameworks of liberal ideology in favor of a more dialectical understanding of class conflict. Only then can the Left genuinely advance the cause of socialism.
