##  Kirk’s calculation that gun deaths were worth the price of liberty perfectly mimics the irony of capitalism. 

{{< image src="rest_in_piss_charlie_kirk.webp" alt="Charlie Kirk was assassinated on September 10th, 2025" >}}

The bourgeois press weeps for a fallen ideologue, framing the demise of Charlie Kirk as a tragedy of political violence. Let’s be honest, this wasn’t a tragedy. His assassination was the consequence of his own reactionary political ideology steeped in the rhetoric of violence. With this in mind, we must analyze this event not with liberal sentimentality and pearl clutching currently being bandied about, but with a materialist rigor that doesn’t moralize fallen reprobates. Kirk’s end was the logical conclusion of the very forces he unleashed, a violent symptom of a social order in a state of advanced decay. He lived by the gun, ideologically speaking, and he perished by it.

The crocodile tears of liberal politicians likes of Gavin Newsom and Kamala Harris, who preside over a system of relentless police violence, imperialist slaughter, and the slow death of economic deprivation, now feign horror at a single act of “reprehensible” violence. Their selective outrage is a performance meant to uphold bourgeois order. We are told to mourn Kirk, but when were we asked to mourn the thousands of Palestinian children immolated by the weaponry of capital’s imperial proxies? If these liberals could summon even a fraction of their current indignation for the victims of their own system, their pronouncements might carry weight. Instead, they inundate us with their sanctimonious noise, revealing that their concern is not for life but for the stability of their class rule.

Charlie Kirk was not a philosopher, he wasn't even a decent debater, what he was, was a functionary. His purpose was to manufacture consent for the ruling class, to keep the proletariat confused and divided. His organization, Turning Point USA, served as a conduit for Christofascist ideology, packaging the interests of capital as the “God-given rights” of the common man. His frantic defense of the Second Amendment was never about popular defense against tyranny, it was about sanctifying private property and the right of the individual capitalist to protect their assets against the working class. By convincing a segment of that very same working class that their interests align with their exploiters, Kirk performed a valuable service, generating a thick fog of false consciousness to obscure the reality of class antagonism.

> “You will never live in a society when you have an armed citizenry and you won’t have a single gun death… That is nonsense. It’s drivel. But I think it’s worth to have a cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the _Second Amendment_ to protect our other God-given rights. That is a prudent deal. It is rational. Nobody talks like this. They live in a complete alternate universe.

To fully grasp the American obsession with firearms that Kirk so effectively manipulated, one must understand the concept of [commodity fetishism](https://www.workers.org/2013/02/7256/). The gun is not merely a tool, it is a fetishized object, imbued by bourgeois ideology with mystical powers of freedom, sovereignty, and security. This fetishism obscures the real social relations of its production and its function as an instrument of class society. It appears as a sacred relic of liberty, detached from the systemic violence it perpetuates. This is how a rational-sounding argument can be made for accepting thousands of deaths as a “prudent deal.” The real, material horror of a near-daily parade of dead children is rendered abstract, less important than the worship of a fetishized commodity and the ideology it represents.

The dialectic is a merciless process. A force, once unleashed, inevitably calls forth its opposite. Kirk and his ilk championed a society saturated with the instruments of death, arguing that an armed citizenry was the ultimate check on state power. What they cultivated was not a bulwark against government overreach, but a paranoid, atomized society where violence becomes the first resort for settling disputes, both personal and political. They sowed the wind of violent rhetoric and paranoid fantasies, and in Utah, the whirlwind was reaped. His death serves as an example of what the anarchists once called [_propaganda of the deed_](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/category/topic/propaganda-of-the-deed), an act of violence intended to inspire others to action.   
> “We have to be vicious, just like they are. It’s the only thing they understand.”

This quote from his [Twitter account](https://x.com/charliekirk11/status/1965458939644109294) the day before his assassination was a call to action. Kirk was telling those he had made a career out of manipulating that it was time to engage in violent acts against their perceived enemies. And in an ironic twist of fate the first act of violence was turned back on its most vocal proponent. In a way his death was his own kind of praxis, the unity of theory and practice, in its most brutal and direct form. His ideology of unrestrained viciousness became the force that destroyed him.

Now, the forces of fascist reaction, led by figures like Donald Trump, will attempt to transform this dead pundit into a martyr. They will seek to make Charlie Kirk the [Horst Wessel](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/albert-meltzer-anarchist-activity-in-nazi-germany) of a burgeoning American fascist movement, using his death to justify greater repression, more surveillance, and the further arming of right-wing paramilitaries. The assassination of one man, however odious his views, will not advance the cause of liberation. Instead, his assassination will strengthen the hand of the state and provides the perfect pretext for fascism’s advance. Ultimately, this act of violence demonstrates the futility of individual terror. It is a satisfying expression of rage, to be sure, but it is not a strategy for power.

The christofascists that produced Kirk will simply find another to take his place, perhaps more polished, or more rabid, and with a smaller head. Removing a single easily replaceable ideologue, no matter how deserving, does nothing to alter the fundamental fascist trajectory of the American superstructure. Such acts are a politics of despair, a symptom of the absence of a mass, organized working-class movement. They allow the state to reinforce its monopoly on violence and portray all opposition to capitalism as criminal and terroristic, thereby isolating genuine revolutionaries from the masses whose support is essential. The proper response to the violence of capitalism is not the isolated violence of the assassin, but the organized, _collective power of the mobilized working class_.

Our task is not to target individual personifications of economic categories but to abolish the categories of class society itself. Nor should our goal be a form of self-sabotage where we push for the disarmament of the people while Trump builds a fascist cage around us. No, this moment requires the patient work of education, agitation, and organization to build mobilized class consciousness. The worker must learn to see that their enemy is not a single loudmouthed pundit, but the entire system of wage labor and private property. So, let the liberals perform their empty rituals of mourning and let the fascists attempt to construct their martyr. We understand that Kirk’s death was as meaningless as his life and that this incident is merely another crack appearing in the facade of a dying social order.

Rest in piss you sniveling fuck.
## Jacobin's Liberal Indulgence

The [Jacobin](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:swj6nxxfi5gcpgjdzvo25cri) article [Charlie Kirk’s Murder Is a Tragedy and a Disaster](https://jacobin.com/2025/09/charlie-kirk-murder-political-violence) epitomizes the empty moralistic condemnations that we've come to expect from liberals, not from leftists grounded in a material critique of class society. The article, authored by [Ben Burgis](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:4kjhktszj7qk26x7efwth62m) and Meagan Day, fails to grasp the true nature of political violence and the necessity of a materialist perspective. Instead, they engage in liberal hand-wringing that upholds bourgeois norms, suggesting that political violence threatens the very fabric of liberation. This is a pitiful display of ideological weakness.

Instead of focusing on whether political violence is justifiable in the abstract, we should be evaluating which acts of violence serve the interests of the proletariat. The assassination of Charlie Kirk, an ardent supporter of the exploiters of the working class, appears to be an isolated, adventurist act. It was unconnected to any broader left working-class movement or strategy, making it doubtful that it will advance or contract our objectives in any meaningful way. Jacobin's broad rejection of political violence only serves to reinforce the liberal narrative that state violence and anti-capitalist resistance are morally equivalent a dangerous and misleading notion.

The ruling class has long understood that violence is a powerful tool, wielding it daily through state repression, economic coercion, and imperialist warfare. Yet, Jacobin suggests that the Left should unilaterally disarm, morally and rhetorically. This is an appalling betrayal, as it ignores the reality of a life-and-death struggle where only the naive believe that the ruling class needs no pretext to attack working-class organizations. If anything, calls for calm and de-escalation only embolden fascist forces, indicating that the Left can be intimidated into passivity. This dynamic has played out countless times, with pleas to respectability being as effective as pissing in a hurricane.

Jacobin’s uncritical adoption of the language of "tragedy" and "disaster" is reflective of bourgeois sentimentality rather than revolutionary clarity. Kirk was an enemy of the working class, actively working to undermine even minimal reforms that could improve proletarian living standards. That his violent rhetoric and policies may have contributed to an environment conducive to political violence is an irony worth noting, but it only underscores the contradictions of the system he served. We need not and should not shed tears for the lackeys of our oppressors, even when they fall victim to tactics unrelated to our own strategic orientation.

The real problem with Kirk’s assassination is not its use of violence but the fact that it appears to be an isolated act of right-wing reactionary violence. Individual acts of violence, divorced from mass action, cannot substitute for the patient work of building proletarian organizations capable of wielding force collectively. They often substitute cathartic but ultimately counterproductive expressions of rage for disciplined revolutionary practice. This is the substantive critique worth making, not abstract liberal pieties about the sanctity of life or democratic norms.

We must harness both the symbolic and material potential of such acts, recognizing that sometimes, violence can serve revolutionary ends. This perspective requires abandoning the moralistic frameworks of liberal ideology and embracing a more dialectical understanding of class conflict. Only then can the Left begin to truly advance the cause of socialism. Let us not be fooled by liberal platitudes; revolutionary clarity demands a materialist analysis of class struggle and the instruments of violence that serve it.

Jacobin’s analysis is fundamentally flawed because it embraces liberal moralizing, asserting that no one deserves death for political expression. This perspective aligns Jacobin with bourgeois humanism, which obscures the reality that politics is an extension of war by other means. By framing Kirk’s murder as a threat to "democratic norms" and "free speech," they fail to recognize that such norms exist only as ideological cover for ruling-class hegemony. The Left must not be lulled into complacency by these bourgeois ideals, which have been consistently used to protect the oppressive regime of the ruling class.

Jacobin’s article is a disappointing reflection of when liberal values pop up in Leftist spaces and attempt to capture or co-opt the essence of revolutionary struggle. By moralizing over political violence, they miss the strategic opportunity to analyze the potential gains and losses of specific actions. The real challenge for the Left is to develop a rigorous, materialist perspective that understands the role of violence in class struggle and uses it strategically to advance proletarian interests. We need to move beyond empty condemnations and embrace a dialectical understanding that sees violence as a legitimate tool when in the hands of a mobilized working class pursuing revolutionary socialism.
